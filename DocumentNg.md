- Install Angular globally, switch my nodejs version and created the portfolio project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBt031nQPu0
  *npm install -g @angular/cli
  *npm use 20.15.0
  *ng new portfolio-app
  *ng serve
  *ng s -o
- Next step was to create components which were to be built
  *ng g c components/navbar
  *ng g c pages/home
- Next of was to ensure routing accross the different pages set-up with the previous step, I realised that tha app.routes.ts is very import here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3f0KTdNyA
